# README: Sprint Review and Retrospective – SNHU Travel Application Project  

**Project Title:** Sprint Review and Retrospective – SNHU Travel Application Project  

## Overview  
This project showcases the Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU Travel application, developed as part of ChadaTech’s transition from Waterfall to Agile methodologies. This artifact highlights the use of Scrum roles, Agile ceremonies, and tools like Jira to manage sprints, prioritize tasks, and handle evolving client needs.  

## Essential Questions and Reflections  

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?  
User needs are interpreted through continuous collaboration with stakeholders and by breaking down requirements into clear, actionable user stories. In this project, user stories were essential in translating broad client goals into manageable development tasks. For example, the need for a secure login system was split into smaller subtasks like API development and UI design. This approach allowed for iterative progress, ensuring that features aligned with user expectations. User stories help developers stay focused on delivering value by clearly defining acceptance criteria and the “why” behind each task.  

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?  
I approach program development by emphasizing iterative progress, collaboration, and adaptability. The Agile process, particularly Scrum, structures development through sprints, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. In the SNHU Travel application project, Agile’s iterative nature allowed the team to adjust the backlog and respond to client feedback mid-sprint, such as integrating multi-factor authentication. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate backlog refinement, sprint reviews, and stand-ups to ensure projects remain flexible and aligned with user needs. Agile’s focus on continuous improvement helps refine processes and product quality throughout development.  

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
Being a good team member involves collaboration, accountability, and open communication. During this project, daily stand-ups provided a platform to resolve blockers, share progress, and address dependencies. Team members actively supported each other, ensuring tasks were completed and deliverables met sprint goals. Additionally, contributing to retrospectives allowed the team to reflect on what worked well and identify areas for improvement. A good team member prioritizes collective goals, takes ownership of their tasks, and fosters a positive, solution-focused environment that drives project success.
